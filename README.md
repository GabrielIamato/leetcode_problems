# LeetCode Problems

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode exercises focused on programming logic and data structures. Each exercise is implemented in Python and covers one of the main topics in algorithms and data structures.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide a practical solution to classic programming problems, with an emphasis on understanding and applying essential data structures such as:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Strings**
- **Graphs**
- **Trees**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Searching & Sorting**

The problems are solved incrementally, one per week, focusing on fundamental concepts and algorithm efficiency.

## Repository Structure

The problems are organized into the following categories, with a folder for each topic:

1. **Dynamic Programming**
2. **Searching & Sorting**
3. **Graphs**
4. **Trees**
5. **Linked List**
6. **String**
7. **Arrays**

Each folder contains the following files:

- **Python Code**: Implementations of the algorithms.
- **Problem Description**: Explanation of the exercise and the approach for the solution.
- **Tests**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the solutions.
